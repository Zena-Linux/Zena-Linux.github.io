<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-primary">Introduction to Zena</h1>
<p class="mb-4">Zena is a modern, immutable desktop operating system founded and actively developed by Jian Zcar. It is
  built by orchestrating a careful selection of modern, innovative technologies into a cohesive and refined desktop
  experience. This approach provides a rock-solid, container-native foundation while paradoxically delivering maximum
  flexibility and control within the user's personal environment.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">The Journey</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Zena began with a clear vision: to create a desktop experience that feels complete and powerful without
  unnecessary complexity. It was born from a desire for a system that is relatively light, not stripped to the bone but
  thoughtfully curated, offering reliability without bloat.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Early in its development, Zena drew significant inspiration from projects like Bazzite. Initially built
  around the GNOME desktop for its simplicity, the system evolved by integrating coveted features and ideas from several
  pioneering distributions, including the performance-focused CachyOS, the declarative power of NixOS, and the robust
  foundations of Fedora.</p>
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">The Philosophy</h2>
<p class="mb-4">This synthesis shaped Zena's core philosophy: <strong>"pragmatically immutable."</strong> The base
  operating system is an immutable, atomic image, locked down and updated as a single unit. This provides an unshakable
  foundation, guaranteeing stability and security. You get a ready-to-use desktop with essential, powerful tools for
  modern computing.</p>
<p class="mb-4">However, this solid base is designed for empowerment. It's not a restrictive cage. The immutability
  stops at the system level, freeing the user's personal workspace entirely. Through a carefully curated stack of
  technologies, including container tools like Distrobox and Podman, the expansive Nix package system, and integrated
  home encryption, you are granted expansive freedom. You can install any software, create perfectly reproducible
  development or gaming environments, and customize every aspect of your workflow. The system adapts to your needs, not
  the other way around.</p>
<p class="mb-4">This design extends naturally to multi-user scenarios. On a shared computer, each person gets their own
  isolated, secure environment with separate applications, settings, and encrypted data, all sharing the same robust,
  unchanging foundation underneath.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Zena is ideally suited for developers, gamers, privacy-conscious users, and anyone who values a system
  with minimal maintenance, rock-solid stability, and the freedom to make their workspace truly their own. It represents
  an approach to the Linux desktop that values clarity, performance, and the principled separation of the immutable
  system from the mutable, user-controlled environment.</p>
<p class="mb-4">The project is openly developed by Jian Zcar, with its image definitions, documentation, and builds
  available on GitHub. Welcome to Zena.</p>
