<h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-primary">Introduction to Zena</h1>
<p class="mb-4"> Zena Linux is a modern, immutable desktop operating system founded and actively developed by Jian Zcar.
  It is engineered from the ground up to provide a rock-solid, container-native foundation while paradoxically
  delivering maximum flexibility and control within the user's personal environment. The project was born from a desire
  to create a relatively light, efficient, and reliable bootable image that offers a powerful desktop experience without
  unnecessary complexity or bloat. </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">Philosophy and Evolution</h2>
<p class="mb-4"> Early in its development, Zena drew significant inspiration from projects like Bazzite. Initially built
  around the GNOME desktop for its simplicity, the system evolved by integrating coveted features and ideas from several
  pioneering distributions, including the performance-focused CachyOS, the declarative power of NixOS, and the robust
  foundations of Fedora. This synthesis shaped Zena into a uniquely flexible and practical system that emphasizes
  performance, clarity of design, and user empowerment. </p>
<p class="mb-4"> The core philosophy of Zena is "pragmatically immutable." The base operating system is locked down and
  updated atomically as a single image, guaranteeing stability and reproducibility. However, this immutability is not a
  cage. Through a carefully curated stack of technologies, users are granted expansive freedom to install software,
  customize their environment, and create reproducible workspaces, ensuring the system adapts to the user's needs, not
  the other way around. </p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">Core Technology Stack</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
  As a bootable image, Zena integrates a deliberate stack of technologies that leverage and extend its Fedora base:
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Foundation & Kernel:</strong> Its core is the immutable Fedora base managed by <code>bootc</code>, enabling
  atomic, image-based updates and rollbacks. For enhanced desktop performance, this base is paired with the CachyOS
  kernel, optimized with LTO (Link Time Optimization) and the BORE scheduler for maximum responsiveness.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Desktop & Packages:</strong> The user experience is delivered by Niri, a sleek, column-based tiling window
  manager for Wayland, composed with the Dank Material Shell for a dynamic and themable workflow. User-space software
  management is revolutionized through Nix, providing declarative access to over 120,000 packages, assisted by the
  custom <code>zix</code> helper which offers both imperative commands and declarative configuration via a
  <code>zix.json</code> file for simplified and reproducible operations.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Containers & Security:</strong> The container-native design is first-class, with Podman and Distrobox
  available out-of-the-box. Security is inherent in the immutable design, enforced by SELinux, and extends to user data
  with optional, integrated home directory encryption via <code>systemd-homed</code> and LUKS, creating portable,
  encrypted user homes.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">Extending Functionality with Distrobox</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
  A key feature of Zena's practical design is its use of Distrobox to extend core functionality in a modular, isolated
  way. This approach allows users to add complex software suites without compromising the stability of the immutable
  base image.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  For gaming, Zena provides a simple command, <code>gaming install</code>, which automatically creates a dedicated
  Distrobox container based on CachyOS v3. This container comes pre-configured with major gaming launchers and tools
  like Steam, Heroic, Lutris, and ProtonUp‑Qt. All applications from this container integrate seamlessly with the host
  desktop's app menu. This setup delivers performance at every level: from the LTO-optimized CachyOS kernel on the host
  to the updated libraries within the gaming-specific container.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  Similarly, virtualization and other specialized workflows can be enabled through purpose-built Distrobox containers.
  This methodology ensures that such environments are neatly isolated, user-specific, and can be maintained or discarded
  without affecting the core system, perfectly embodying the principle of keeping the system solid while the user's
  environment remains flexible.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">Multi-User Isolation & Security</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
  Zena is designed for complete separation between users while sharing the same robust foundation. This makes it
  ideal for shared computers, family PCs, or maintaining separate work and personal environments on the same machine.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  Each user benefits from a comprehensive isolation stack:
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Encrypted Home:</strong> Individual LUKS-encrypted home directories for enhanced privacy.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Independent Nix Profiles:</strong> Separate sets of tools, versions, and configurations per user to prevent
  conflicts.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Container Space:</strong> User-specific Distrobox and Podman environments.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  <strong>Application Sandboxing:</strong> GUI applications via Flatpak are isolated per user.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  This layered approach ensures that tools, data, and environments remain protected and separate, providing
  enterprise-grade multi-user support on a personal desktop system.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-secondary">Target Experience</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
  Zena is not designed to be the most minimal system. It is a "complete" image that focuses on providing a robust,
  ready-to-use desktop foundation by default. It strips away unnecessary redundancy but comes pre-equipped with
  essential, powerful tools for modern computing. It is ideally suited for developers, gamers, privacy-conscious users,
  and anyone who values a system with minimal maintenance, rock-solid stability, and effortless reproducibility.
</p>
<p class="mb-4">
  The project is openly developed by Jian Zcar, with its image definitions, documentation, and builds available on
  GitHub. It represents an approach to the Linux desktop that values clarity, performance, and the principled separation
  of the immutable system from the mutable, user-controlled workspace.
